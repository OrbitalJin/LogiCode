# LogiCode

LogiCode is a scripting language that is designed to be used for boolean algebra and logic circuit design. It is a simple language that is easy to learn and use. It is designed to be used on Linux systems. It is written in Go which implements a hand-crafted lexer and parser.

## Architecture

The `Lexer` produces an array of `Tokens` from the source code, which are then passed to the `Parser`. The `Parser` produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (`AST`) which is then passed to the Interpreter. The Interpreter then evaluates the `AST` using evalutation rules and produces an output. Here is a simple diagram that illustrates the architecture:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  I(Src) --> Lexer;
  Lexer --> Parser;
  Parser --> Interpreter;
  Interpreter --> O(Output);
```

## AST

The `AST` is a tree data structure that represents the source code. It is used to evaluate the source code in a recursive manner which
is defined by the grammar of the language. This approach makes it trivial to respect operator precedence and associativity. Here is a simple diagram that illustrates the `AST`:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    P[Program] --> S1[Stmt 1];
    P[Program] --> S2[Stmt 2];
    S1 --> E1[Expr 1];
    S1 --> E2[Expr 2];
    E2 --> T1[Term 1];
    E2 --> F1[Factor];
    F1[Factor] --> T2[Term 2];
    F1[Factor] --> T3[Term 3];

```

Here is a simple example of the `AST` representation of an expression:

Expression: `a & b | c`

```mermaid
graph TD;
    F1[&] --> T1[a];
    F1 --> F2["|"];
    F2 --> T2[b];
    F2 --> T3[c];
```

> **Warning** The `AST` is not a binary tree. It is a tree data structure that can have any number of children.
